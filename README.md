Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a healthcare dataset using Python.

# Healthcare Data Exploration (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare costs using a public dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying relationships between medical charges and patient attributes like age, BMI, and smoking status.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization of trends (e.g., charges by age, BMI, smoking status)
4. Predictive Modeling using Linear Regression

## Files
- `healthcare_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis
- `insurance.csv`: Dataset used in the project

## Results
- Smokers tend to have higher medical charges.
- BMI and age show strong correlations with healthcare costs.
